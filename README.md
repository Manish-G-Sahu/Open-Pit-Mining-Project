# Open-Pit-Mining-Project


Open Pit Mining Smart Live Monitoring System
Project Overview
The Open Pit Mining Smart Live Monitoring System is designed to track and analyze the operations of an open-pit mine. This system provides real-time monitoring of key processes such as digging, crushing, and hauling, helping optimize mining operations for better efficiency and cost reduction. The system integrates data from various operations and visualizes it in an easy-to-understand dashboard.

Key Features
Real-time Data Monitoring: Continuously tracks mining operations including digging, crushing, and other activities.
Data Analytics: Provides insights into operations and identifies inefficiencies or areas for improvement.
Dashboards: Interactive dashboards built using Power BI/Tableau for data visualization and decision-making.
Alerts & Notifications: Real-time alerts for any anomalies or inefficiencies in the operations.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Preprocesses and cleans raw data from different sources for meaningful analysis.
Technologies Used
Data Collection & Database: MySQL Workbench for data storage and querying.
Data Visualization: Tableau / Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.
Programming Languages: Python (for data cleaning, analysis, and automation).
Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization), SQL.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes operational data from the mine, such as:

Digging data: Time and quantity of materials extracted.
Crushing data: Data related to the crushing process, including output and machine performance.
Transportation data: Hauling data, including distances and load times.
Data is collected in real-time from various sensors placed in the equipment and mining site, and the dataset is continuously updated for analysis.

Project Goals
To improve the efficiency of open-pit mining operations by identifying bottlenecks and underperforming areas.
To provide a smart system for mine managers to monitor operations in real-time and make informed decisions.
To automate data collection, cleaning, and visualization for better productivity and resource management.
